# Module Subjectivity reads the subjectivity lexicon file from Wiebe et al
#    at http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/ (part of the Multiple Perspective QA project)
#
# This file has the format that each line is formatted as in this example for the word "abandoned"
#     type=weaksubj len=1 word1=abandoned pos1=adj stemmed1=n priorpolarity=negative
# In our data, the pos tag is ignored, so this program just takes the last one read
#     (typically the noun over the adjective)
#
# The data structure that is created is a dictionary where
#    each word is mapped to a list of 4 things:  
#        strength, which will be either 'strongsubj' or 'weaksubj'
#        posTag, either 'adj', 'verb', 'noun', 'adverb', 'anypos'
#        isStemmed, either true or false
#        polarity, either 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'
